   These years have been a very exciting era for particle physics with the construction, startup and running of the highest energy accelerator in the world. The LHC has given experimentalists access to energies that have never been explored before. The ATLAS and CMS experiments have already produced important discoveries and show potential hints of new physics. As experimenters at the LHC, we are all eagerly looking forward to collecting more data in the coming years to search for new physics that could help us better understand particle physics and possibly astrophysics and cosmology. The findings at the LHC could help answer important questions about the mechanism that gives rise to the observed light Higgs boson mass and the nature of dark matter.<br><br>

   We are focused on firmware development and hardware testing for the New Small Wheel (NSW) scheduled for installation in 2018. We are also responsible for providing the Micromegas detector's digitization and trigger simulations.

   <center><img src="../img/paragraph-separator-2.gif" width=25%></center>
   We are performing the first dedicated search for decays of the Higgs boson to a pair of new spin-zero particles that subsequently decay to b-quarks and muons. We have defined the analysis strategy for the H->4b search and developed background estimation methods. This search in ATLAS targets 2016 using the 13 TeV data collected. <br><br>

   We are designing a readout board to collect the data from the muon drift tube chambers (MDTs) and send it to the trigger and readout. The installation of the Phase-II upgraded electronics is expected around 2025.
